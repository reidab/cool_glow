Cool Glow
=========
For years, I've been using a variant of [Mark Dodwell's Cool Glow
theme](http://mkdynamic.wordpress.com/2006/11/13/textmate-theme-cool-glow/)
for my TextMate and Terminal color scheme. I recently used
[Coloration](http://coloration.sickill.net/) to convert it to a vim GUI
colorscheme and made a few tweaks.

Here is the result.
